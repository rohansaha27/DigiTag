# DigiTag - Secure Luxury Resale with Blockchain

## What's Our Inspiration Behind DigiTag?
Canadaâ€™s Luxury Resale Market is expanding, yet it is increasingly undermined by counterfeit products; studies suggest that up to 30% of online luxury transactions involve inauthentic items, resulting in both financial loss and damage of the legacy.  
Fraudulent resale incidents have become a significant concern, with many victims losing thousands of dollars and approximately 40% of cases remaining unresolved due to regulatory shortcomings. In addition, nearly 25% of online platforms lack adequate anti-counterfeit measures, leaving consumers exposed.  

In response, DigiTag leverages blockchain technology to secure luxury transactions through immutable ledgers and cryptographic verification. By employing smart contracts, the platform offers a refined solution that enhances product authenticity and protects buyer interests across international markets.

## What It Does?
DigiTag is a blockchain-powered web application that secures the sale and resale of luxury items, focusing on Chanel handbags. It employs cryptographic authentication and decentralised ledgers to verify ownership, ensuring provenance integrity and eliminating counterfeit risks.  

ðŸŒŸ **Blockchain-Powered Authentication** â€“ Each item is minted as an NFT on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain, serving as immutable proof of ownership and authenticity.  

ðŸŒŸ **Fraud Prevention** â€“ The platform enforces stringent seller identity verification, mitigating the risk of counterfeit goods infiltrating the market.  

ðŸŒŸ **Seamless User Experience** â€“ A React-based interface delivers an intuitive, Amazon-like shopping experience, complemented by robust authentication via Internet Identity (II).  

ðŸŒŸ **Ownership Transfer & Resale** â€“ Authenticated luxury items can be resold with a verifiable blockchain transaction history, preserving provenance integrity.

## Lessons We Learned?
In the course of development, we gained invaluable insights into the complexities of integrating blockchain technology with real-world applications. From the intricacies of NFT-based authentication and smart contract development to the challenges of decentralised identity management, each hurdle refined our understanding.  

We learned the importance of balancing security with user experience, ensuring seamless transactions without compromising on trust. Additionally, the need for blockchain scalability to future-proof the platform against the growing luxury resale market became a crucial focus.  

These experiences have not only shaped the platform but also strengthened our approach to building secure, scalable, and innovative solutions.

## Why Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)?
We selected Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for its decentralised, scalable, and cost-effective nature, making it ideally suited for Web3 applications.  

Unlike traditional blockchains, which are often hindered by high gas fees and slow transaction speeds, ICP offers several compelling advantages. It eliminates gas fees entirely, ensuring cost-efficient transactions for users. The platformâ€™s decentralised hosting infrastructure provides a tamper-proof environment, with the entire applicationâ€”front-end, back-end, and databaseâ€”hosted on ICP, enhancing security.  

ICPâ€™s scalability further ensures that the system can accommodate increasing user demand without compromising on performance. Its Internet Identity system allows for secure user authentication without the need for passwords, reducing the risk of fraud. Additionally, ICPâ€™s smart contract functionality supports trustful transactions, ensuring that ownership transfers occur only when payments are verified.  

These robust features make ICP the ideal blockchain solution for DigiTag, where security, transparency, and cost-efficiency are paramount for a secure luxury resale platform.

## How We Incorporated ICP?
DigiTag leverages ICPâ€™s powerful blockchain capabilities in multiple ways:  

- **NFT Authentication** â€“ Each item is minted as an NFT on ICP, providing immutable ownership proof.  
- **Decentralized Identity (II)** â€“ ICPâ€™s passwordless logins ensure secure authentication and prevent fraud.  
- **On-Chain Hosting** â€“ Full application hosting on ICP ensures security and decentralisation.  
- **Ownership Transfer** â€“ ICP canisters manage secure ownership transfers and prevent counterfeit listings.
